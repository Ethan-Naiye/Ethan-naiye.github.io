Change detection, as an important and widely applied technique in the field of remote sensing, aims to analyze
changes in surface areas over time and has broad application
s
in areas such as environmental monitoring, urban development,
and land use analysis. Due to the complexity of multi-source
data in remote sensing images, such as sensor modality differences, noise, registration errors, and complex terrain, accurate
change detection faces numerous challenges. In recent years,
deep learning, especially the development of foundation models,
has provided more powerful solutions for feature extractio
n
and data fusion, effectively addressing these complexities. This
paper systematically reviews the latest advancements in th
e
field of change detection, with a focus on the application of
foundation models in remote sensing tasks. First, we introduce
the basic knowledge of change detection tasks, including task
definitions, Transformer models, self-attention mechanisms, multimodal learning, foundation models, and vision-language models.
Next, we provide a detailed classification of existing methods
based on data modalities (single-modal and multi-modal) an
d
network structures (encoder, decoder, encoder-decoder). This
review provides readers with a comprehensive understandin
g
of the field and summarizes the advantages and limitations
of various methods. Finally, we summarize the performance
of models on several key benchmark datasets, including newl
y
proposed large-scale benchmarks, and compare them with other
change detection models, offering an in-depth analysis of the role
and limitations of foundation models in change detection. Based
on this, we propose future research directions for remote sensing
change detection. This paper provides a systematic review of the
application of foundation models in the field of remote sensing
change detection and offers insights for further exploration in
this area.
