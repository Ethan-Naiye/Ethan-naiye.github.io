I am now a master student at Renewable Energy with Artificial Intelligence and Data Science from Imperial College London. I have completed my bachelor degree at University of Liverpool and achieved first class honours degree. 

My research interest includes multimodal longitudinal medical data modeling and multimodal large language model.

I am also looking for potential research assistant/research intern opportunities in these fields.
