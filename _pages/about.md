I am Zihan Yu (于子涵), currently a Master’s student in Renewable Energy with Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at Imperial College London. Prior to this, I obtained my Bachelor’s degree with First Class Honours from University of Liverpool in 2025. 

From 2024 to 2025, I worked as a Research Assistant at University of Liverpool, focusing on developing efficient Vision Language Models for image deepfake detection. Prior to that, I worked as a Research Intern at the National Institute of Health Data Science, Peking University from 2023-2024, where I explored the application of Large Language Models in critical care medicine.

My research interest includes multimodal longitudinal medical data modeling and multimodal large language model.

You can find my CV here: [Zihan Yu's Curriculm Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf)

I am also looking for potential research assistant/research intern opportunities in these fields.
