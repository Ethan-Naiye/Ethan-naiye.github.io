I am Zihan Yu (于子涵), currently a Master’s student in Renewable Energy with Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at Imperial College London. Prior to this, I obtained my Bachelor’s degree with First Class Honours from University of Liverpool in 2025. 

From 2024 to 2025, I worked as a Research Assistant at University of Liverpool, focusing on developing efficient Vision Language Models for image deepfake detection. Prior to that, I worked as a Research Intern at the National Institute of Health Data Science, Peking University from 2023-2024, where I explored the application of Large Language Models in critical care medicine.

I am particularly interested in Multimodal Longitudinal Medical Data Modeling and efficient multimodal large langugae model in healthcare. My research aims to explore the gap between diverse medical modalities over time such as analyzing the evolving relationship between past laboratory reports and recent imaging data. 

By harnessing the power of Multimodal Large Language Models, I work towards building systems capable of predicting future health trajectories and identifying risks of multimorbidity, ultimately contributing to personalized medicine.

You can find my CV here: [Zihan Yu's CV](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf)

I am also looking for potential research assistant/research intern opportunities in these fields.
